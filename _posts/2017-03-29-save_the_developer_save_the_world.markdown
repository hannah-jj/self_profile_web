Technology has certainly changed the world and will continue to do so.  On the way back from the hospital, I can't forget the faces of my cousin-in-law, her husband and her mother, and I want to share a message with fellow students.

My cousin-in-law just had a successful kidney implant yesterday and everyone in the family is relived and grateful that she will be alive for more years.  She has been waiting for a compatible kidney for a while, I offered to test my compatibility as well, but that got ruled out immediately since our blood type is different.  Then I mentioned to her about a movie that I saw on Netflix, **The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms**. It talked about how algorithm changed the world, and one of examples being matching living kidney donors.

For families who are waiting for organ donation, the thoughts are complicated. No one wants to wish ill on another family, but for an organ to become available, that usually means someone else's family has lost a loved one.  In a way, families waiting for kidney transplant may call them lucky, because family member can be a living organ donor.  The issues come in when one family member wants to donate, but donor and donee's vitals are not compatible.  Then comes an algorithm that can match donors.  

For example, donor A wants to donate a kidney to A's friend/family, A1. There is another donor B who wants to donate to B1. Both family wouldn't be able to save their loved ones despite the best intent.  If they get connected via http://www.giveakidney.org/, computer algorithms can work the magic and match up the donors, thus A -> B1, while B -> A1.  Or in more complicated cases, the donation can involve more than 2 families.

It was lucky that her husband tested compatible and ended up being the donor.  She remembered my suggestion and asked her doctor, and indeed there is such a program, and it helped to get more transplants to needed people in the recent years.

If you are interested, check out the movie on Netflix: [The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5818010/plotsummary?ref_=tt_stry_pl)

Algorithms can change the world, and we can make a difference as a developer!

On a lighter note, I wish everyone a healthy life and you may consider adding blood type O to your list of finding a significant half. They come in handy if anyone needs an organ/blood donor.  People with O blood type can save your life!!!
