I am on my third month of Maternity leave, so while I am not feeding/playing/changing diaper for newborn, feeding/playing 3-year-old toddler, feeding/caring for myself, I am taking online classes or reading books on coding. <!--more-->With the help from my mom in law and my husband, I could still fit into the busy schedule to catch Dr. Strange, Rogue One, and the new season of Sherlock! Who needs 6 hour of sleep when we can get lost in a galaxy far far away or in 221B Baker Street or in FizzBuzz?

Looking back at the roads or the roads not taken, I am glad where I am now. Though, that means abandoning the 10 years of experiences in the field of tax accounting and venture into the field of developer.  It has been an ironic and fun journey, my parents insisted that I should major in Accounting, but I went for the “cool-er” degree, Applied Physics, which required a computer science or a math minor.  After taking the intro Java class, I was hooked on programming! I decided to dual major in CS as well.  With a semester to study abroad, and two classes overlapping between the two majors, I planned everything almost perfectly aiming to graduate with only 3.5 years actual studying time, but things never go as planned.

The experiment (involving spider) for senior class didn’t go well and one of the class no longer qualify as fulfilling both majors. I had to decide for myself to abandon one major, I chose the “cool” one over the “fun” one. I told myself, coding is fun, and making something fun into a career may not be a fun move down the road.  Somehow down the road I ended up in the world of accounting and went back to school for another degree in accounting, the “practical” major.

Accounting, like many other fields, have been revolutionized by technology dramatically in the past decade: from the rise of personal tax software such as Turbo Tax to mega-rich-companies integrating technologies collecting tax and finance data on the fly.  I was fortunate enough to have witnessed firsthand multi-million contracts between big investment company and big-4 accounting firm embracing technology, seamlessly integrating data to tax reporting software and producing reports within a few hours instead of thousands of hours. So, I find myself again at a cross road, to stay in the practical and safe world of accounting or to venture into something unknown.

My choice, as evidential by this blog is to take the path that I didn't take years ago, and here I am typing away my first blog.  

Cheers to 2017!
